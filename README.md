## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery to allow a user to order pizza. The website is essentially an order form, which walks to user through ordering a pizza, step-by-step. The first step, the user enters their name. The second step, the user selects which toppings they'd like on their pizza. The website has four drop-down menus where the user can select one topping from each category: meat, cheese, veggies and sauce. The third step, the user selects the size of pizza they'd like to order. Once the user has made their selections, they press a button to submit their order. The price is calculated, and the user's name and order is displayed, along with the price of their order.
